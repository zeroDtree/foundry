"""Integration tests for graceful failure on bad inputs.

``rf3 fold`` should exit non-zero with a clear error rather than hang or crash
uncontrollably.  ``run_rf3_fold`` raises :class:`RuntimeError` on a non-zero
exit, so each test simply asserts that.

Both cases below fail during input discovery / parsing — *before* the model is
loaded — so they are fast (~15-20 s, dominated by import time).

Note: an *unknown CCD code* (e.g. ``ccd_code: "ZZ9"``) is deliberately not
tested here — ``rf3 fold`` tolerates it, folding the component as unknown atoms
with a warning rather than failing.
